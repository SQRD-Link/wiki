I'm pretty new to Bazarr, but this message was in notifications when I installed it recently, dated 10 months ago:  
"Opensubtitles.org is now only accessible to VIP users. If you're still using it and do not plan to get a VIP subscription, you should consider disabling it and move to opensubtitles.com."  
I use these providers: addic7ed, animetosho, embeddedsubtitles,Â [opensubtitles.com](http://opensubtitles.com/), supersubtitles, tvsubtitles, and yifysubtitles.  
Addic7ed and Opensubs require an account/username/api, but are free.  
I don't know how long it took, since I had this running for a few weeks previously, but 99% of 1100 movies and 90% of 9000 episodes, now have subs.  
Hope that helps anyway, good luck!
